### Extracting Energy Components from Simulation Logs.
We are now ready to use pytraj in the Jupyter notebook. Letâ€™s plot energies from the simulation logs of our equilibration runs.

First, we load *`pandas`* and *`matplotlib`* modules. Then move into the directory where the input data files are located: 
~~~
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

%cd ~/workshop_pytraj/example_01
~~~
{: .language-python}

Extract some energy components (total energy, temperature, pressure, and volume) from the equilibration log and save them in the file *`energy.dat`*:
~~~
!./extract_energies.sh equilibration_1.log
~~~
{: .language-python}

File *extract_energies.sh* is shell script calling *cpptraj* program to do the job:
~~~
#!/bin/bash
echo "Usage: extract_energies simulation_log_file" 
log=$1

cpptraj << EOF
readdata $log
writedata energy.dat $log[Etot] $log[TEMP] $log[PRESS] $log[VOLUME] time 0.1
EOF
~~~
{:.file-content}

### Plotting energy components
Read the data saved in the file *`energy.dat`* into a pandas dataframe and plot it:
~~~
df=pd.read_table('energy.dat', delim_whitespace=True)
df.columns=["Time", "Etot", "Temp", "Press", "Volume"]
df.plot(subplots=True, x="Time", xlabel="Time, ps", figsize=(6, 8))
plt.show()
~~~
